**Enigmatica 2: Expert - Extended** is an addon for [Enigmatica 2: Expert](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica2expert)

The aim of the addon is to make `E2E` even **more interesting** and **challenging**. Balance it out as much as possible, but leave the most interesting stuff untouched.

## Mods

Here are `+200` up-to-date 1.12.2 mods (about 400 total). Despite this, the modpack **only takes 30% longer** to load than the original E2E. And the **FPS** in the game is **even higher**.

10+ additional major mods and +200 tweaking and Quality of Life addons. Most important of them:

- ❤️ `Scaling Health`
- 🛡️ `Construct's Armory`
- ⛏️ `Harder Branch Mining`
- ▪️▪️ `Little Tiles`
- 🐀 `Rats`
- 🐉 `Tinker's Evolution`

See full list in [MODS.md](MODS.md)

## Principles

- ### No OP items. No exploits. Less cheese  

  No item should disable bunch of other items.  
  Work towards crafting the powerful items, or use less powerful alternatives.  
  *![](https://git.io/JOv9z "Angel Ring") The Angel Ring is harder to give way to all other flight options.*
  *![](https://git.io/JOv92 "Terrasteel") Сan no longer be easily cheesed through the mob stripping farm..*

- ### Less miners -> more manual mining + processing  

  *![](https://git.io/JOv90 "Sieve") Gave you Stack/Second of ore. Got nerf. But new x7 ore processing line comes in.*

- ### Tinker's Hegemony  

  Material balance was reworked, OP traits remapped. Mobs spawn with random TCon's weapons.  
  *![](https://git.io/JGncx "Osgloglas") Is no longer the only correct option.*

- ### More adventuring  

  Better caves, additional structures, more loot, reworked planets.  
  *![](https://git.io/Jze1z "Rocket Assembling Machine") Added a variety of new resources and unique terrain on planets and other dimensions.*

- ### Clear guide  

  Quests and recipes reveal unpopular "hidden" mechanics  
  *![](https://git.io/JtJMc "Book") More Quest chapters describing "forgotten" items*
